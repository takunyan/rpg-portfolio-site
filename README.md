## Why do I make this site

I wanted an interesting portfolio site that could be used for job hunting.
If the site is like a game, it will keep me motivated to keep updating it and I will be able to connect with people who have similar tastes.

## Future Feature

1. add my portfolios
1. use my own logo

1. improve level up system
1. change this site to a responsive design site
